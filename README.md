# Using Binder to Host your Notebooks
[Binder](https://mybinder.org) is a great and free service that makes it easy for someone to share their Jupyter notebooks for others to both view and run. Binder works by taking a GitHub repository and building a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image. Using [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Binder runs a Docker container of the built Docker image.

All the notebooks for this repo are stored in the `notebooks` directory.
Included are the exercises from the 12 Day Program, specfically `notebooks/DAY4_pandas.ipynb` and `notebooks/DAY5_matplotlib.ipynb`.
